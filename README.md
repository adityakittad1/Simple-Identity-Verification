### Contract Code (Simple Identity Verification in Clarity):

```lisp
;; Simple Identity Verification Contract

;; Define the contract owner (only the owner can verify identities)
(define-constant contract-owner tx-sender)

;; Error constants
(define-constant err-owner-only (err u100))
(define-constant err-identity-exists (err u101))
(define-constant err-identity-not-found (err u102))

;; Define a map for storing identities
(define-map identities principal string)

;; Register a new identity
(define-public (register-identity (identity-id string))
  (begin
    (asserts! (is-eq tx-sender contract-owner) err-owner-only)
    (asserts! (not (map-get? identities tx-sender)) err-identity-exists)
    (map-set identities tx-sender identity-id)
    (ok true)))

;; Verify identity by checking if the identity exists for a given principal
(define-public (verify-identity (account principal))
  (let ((identity (map-get? identities account)))
    (match identity
      identity-id (ok identity-id)
      none (err err-identity-not-found))))

### README File for the Project:

# Simple Identity Verification Contract

## 1. Project Title

**Simple Identity Verification**

## 2. Project Description

This project implements a smart contract for identity verification using the Clarity programming language. The contract allows users to register their identities (e.g., username or ID) and verify whether an identity exists for a given principal (user address). The contract includes the basic functionality to register and verify identities in a secure and decentralized manner.

## 3. Project Vision

The vision of the **Simple Identity Verification** contract is to provide a foundation for building decentralized applications (dApps) where user identity verification is necessary. It aims to enable projects to use a simple, secure, and immutable way to verify users without relying on a centralized authority.

## 4. Future Scope

In the future, the **Simple Identity Verification** contract can be enhanced by adding more advanced features like:

* Allowing users to update their identity information.
* Implementing multi-signature checks for more secure verification.
* Allowing users to attach additional metadata to their identities (e.g., personal information, documents).
* Integrating the contract with other decentralized systems for seamless identity verification across platforms.

## 5. Contract Add

Here is the contract code for the **Simple Identity Verification**:

```lisp
;; Simple Identity Verification Contract

;; Define the contract owner (only the owner can verify identities)
(define-constant contract-owner tx-sender)

;; Error constants
(define-constant err-owner-only (err u100))
(define-constant err-identity-exists (err u101))
(define-constant err-identity-not-found (err u102))

;; Define a map for storing identities
(define-map identities principal string)

;; Register a new identity
(define-public (register-identity (identity-id string))
  (begin
    (asserts! (is-eq tx-sender contract-owner) err-owner-only)
    (asserts! (not (map-get? identities tx-sender)) err-identity-exists)
    (map-set identities tx-sender identity-id)
    (ok true)))

;; Verify identity by checking if the identity exists for a given principal
(define-public (verify-identity (account principal))
  (let ((identity (map-get? identities account)))
    (match identity
      identity-id (ok identity-id)
      none (err err-identity-not-found))))
```

This simple contract is a starting point for any dApp that needs user identity verification. It ensures that only the contract owner can register identities, but anyone can verify their identity.
