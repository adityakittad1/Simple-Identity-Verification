# Simple Identity Verification

## 1. Project Title
**Simple Identity Verification on Stacks Blockchain**

## 2. Project Description
This project provides a minimal on-chain identity registration and verification system using the Clarity smart contract language on the Stacks blockchain.  
It allows users to register their identity (name and hashed ID) and enables others to verify if a given user has registered.

## 3. Project Vision
The vision is to offer a secure, decentralized, and tamper-proof identity layer for blockchain applications.  
By keeping data on-chain, trustless verification becomes possible for DeFi apps, voting systems, and membership platforms.

## 4. Future Scope
- Integration with decentralized identity (DID) standards.
- Adding signature-based verification for stronger authentication.
- Support for off-chain storage of sensitive data with on-chain hashes.
- Multi-factor verification for high-security applications.
